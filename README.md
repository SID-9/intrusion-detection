# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## Project Overview

This project involves developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect and prevent unauthorized access to a network. The IDS uses machine learning techniques to identify suspicious activity and potential threats. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using a Python script.

## Repository Structure

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- **IDS Final.docx**: A document detailing the final report or documentation for the IDS project.
- **balanced-ids.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the IDS with balanced data.
- **ids.py**: The Python script for deploying the IDS model.

## Motivation

With the increasing number of cyber-attacks, it is essential to have robust security measures to protect networks and systems. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) helps in monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators to potential security breaches. This project leverages machine learning to create an effective IDS that can detect and prevent unauthorized access in real-time.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes network traffic data with various features representing different types of network activities. The data is labeled to indicate whether an instance is normal or an intrusion, which helps in training the machine learning model to distinguish between legitimate and malicious activities.

## Preprocessing Techniques

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Balancing the Data**: Addressing class imbalance to ensure the model performs well across all classes.
4. **Scaling**: Normalizing the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

## Model Implementation

The machine learning model is developed using the following steps:

1. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
3. **Model Training**: Training the model on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Deployment

The IDS model is deployed using a Python script, providing a real-time monitoring system with the following features:

1. **Real-time Detection**: Continuously monitoring network traffic and detecting intrusions.
2. **Alerting**: Sending alerts to administrators when suspicious activity is detected.
3. **Logging**: Recording details of detected intrusions for further analysis.

## Results

The IDS model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting intrusions and potential threats. The system provides real-time alerts and logs for administrators to review, enhancing the overall security posture of the network.

## Future Work

- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with additional algorithms and hyperparameters to improve detection accuracy.
- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporate more features to capture a broader range of network activities.
- **Advanced Alerting**: Develop more sophisticated alerting mechanisms, including email and SMS notifications.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the application of machine learning in cybersecurity, providing a robust Intrusion Detection System to monitor and protect networks. By leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and a well-trained model, the IDS offers effective and real-time intrusion detection capabilities.
